0:01Narrator: To produce 1 pound of coffee beans,
0:03farmers need to harvest more than 1,500 of these cherries.
0:09Each one contains two seeds that will be sorted,
0:13processed, and roasted before they reach your cup.
0:18In 2022, the average US price
0:21for a pound of coffee was $5.89.
0:25But there's a specialty category
0:27called single-origin coffee
0:29that can easily cost over $30 per pound.
0:32Some exclusive harvests cost over $80 per pound.
0:37So, what makes this coffee so special?
0:40And why is it so expensive?
Growing coffee
0:44It's November in Nyeri County, Kenya,
0:47and the coffee harvest is in full swing.
0:50There are over 12.5 million coffee farms in the world.
0:54Almost 95% are owned by smallholders, like Joseph.
0:59He runs a 1-acre farm,
1:01part of which he inherited from his parents.
1:04Coffee is all about quality.
1:06If you produce coffee with a higher quality,
1:10the higher prices you get for your coffee.
1:13Narrator: Coffee grows differently
1:15depending on the altitude, climate, soil, and sun.
1:19Farms here sit around 1,700 meters above sea level
1:23in rich volcanic soil.
1:26Joseph: The coffee grow very slow.
1:28They take a long time to mature.
1:30And the longer coffee take time to mature,
1:33the better the quality.
1:34Almost everywhere, every farmer is growing coffee.
1:39Narrator: High-altitude coffee
1:40produces fruity and floral flavors.
1:43Drinking coffee brewed from beans
1:45exclusively from one region
1:47ensures that those distinct flavors come through.
1:50It's what's called single-origin coffee;
1:52the quality and unique taste
1:54are the biggest reasons it can cost so much.
1:58But achieving that quality isn't easy.
Harvesting
2:01The terrain here is too uneven for machines,
2:04so farmers pick the coffee by hand,
2:06one cherry at a time.
2:09For coffee, ripeness is key.
2:30Narrator: Mary has been growing coffee for over 25 years.
2:46Narrator: Each branch has ripe and unripe cherries,
2:49so she has to pay close attention while picking.
Commodity vs. specialty coffee
2:56The way coffee is harvested here in Kenya
2:59is very different from how it's done in Brazil,
3:01
the world's largest coffee producer.3:03
On huge farms with flat terrain, the harvest is mechanized.
3:08The trees are at a lower elevation,
3:10and the yields are higher.
3:13Mechanized production is more efficient,
3:15but this efficiency can hurt quality control.
3:18When the whole tree is picked at once,
3:21ripe and unripe cherries are lumped together.
3:24This is commodity coffee,
3:26destined for mass production and industrial use.
3:29Its price is low and volatile.
3:33The highest-quality coffee is called specialty coffee.
3:37This coffee has unique attributes
3:39that expert tasters, called Q graders,
3:41rate the highest.
3:43Single-origin coffee is often rated
3:45at the highest end of specialty coffee
3:47because of its distinct flavors.
3:50Both specialty coffee and a lot of commodity coffee
3:53come from the same plant, Coffea arabica.
3:56But not all arabica coffee is created equal.
4:00This can of ground coffee is 100% arabica.
4:04It costs around $8 a pound.
4:07In 2022, a single-origin coffee grown in Panama
4:10sold for over $6,000 a pound at auction —
4:14also 100% arabica.
4:17The better the flavor and the smaller the harvest,
4:19the more expensive the coffee.
Sorting
4:23Back at Mary's farm, there's still work to be done.
4:28After harvesting, workers sort the cherries
4:30to weed out any defects.
4:32These negatively impact the flavor
4:34and lower the price of the coffee.
4:39But they need to work quickly.
4:41Processing coffee soon after harvest
4:43is key to maintaining its quality.
4:50Processing infrastructure is expensive,
4:53so most farms in Kenya share centralized facilities.
5:01Over 1,000 farmers from the region
5:03bring their coffee here.
Washed process
5:09Each processing method has a different impact on taste,
5:14but they all have the same end goal:
5:16separate the seed from the fruit.
5:19These are the five stages of coffee processing.
5:22The red cherry, the wet parchment,
5:25dry parchment, green coffee, and roasted coffee beans.
5:30Narrator: This is the washed process.
5:32It's the most common way to process coffee in Kenya.
5:36After weighing and inspecting the coffee,
5:38workers remove the outer skin
5:40in a process called de-pulping.
5:45Then they place it in fermentation tanks,
5:47where it rests for 12 to 14 hours.
5:51Fermentation breaks down the mucilage,
5:53the sticky inner layer of the fruit,
5:55so it can be washed away.
5:59The next day, workers push coffee
6:01through a series of channels, cleaning off the seeds.
6:06This is also where one
6:07of several grading processes takes place.
6:11Workers separate lower-quality, less dense beans,
6:14which float to the surface.
6:17Even though these beans sell for less,
6:19they still provide important income to producers.
6:27The denser coffee flows to soaking tanks
6:30to ensure any remaining mucilage is removed.
6:39Once the seed is free, the coffee flows out of the tanks
6:42and onto drying tables.
Roasting
6:46Roasters sell coffee
6:48either as a blend of beans from different countries
6:50or as single origin.
6:53But there's no officially agreed-upon
6:54definition of the term.
6:56It can refer to a farm, a cooperative, or a country.
7:00Consumers who buy this type of coffee
7:02are usually seeking a particular flavor or aroma.
7:06The costs of processing, transportation,
7:09and running a roasting business
7:10are all bundled into the price customers pay for coffee.
7:14It's so expensive to get coffee here.
7:16Everything from the farm to the port,
7:19everything has gone up.
7:20The boxes where we ship your coffee for subscriptions
7:23or at-home consumption, that packaging has gone up.
7:27With single origin, single producer,
7:29when you have the producer's name,
7:31it's an indicator that we paid more for that coffee
7:34because of the relationship.
7:35If you're paying in the range of $21 to $26,
7:39it's because we've invested in these areas
7:41that are important to us and we hope are important to them.
7:44Narrator: Companies like Metric play an important role
7:47in the coffee supply chain.
7:49Most coffee is consumed outside of the country
7:51it's produced in.
7:53And how coffee is roasted has a big impact on its taste.
7:57Getting the best flavor out of single-origin coffee
8:00requires careful roasting.
8:03Coffee is roasted in big machines like this.
8:07Roasters take green coffee
8:09and heat it evenly to develop its flavor.
8:13Hara: This is 20 pounds of
8:15Costa Rican honey-processed coffee from Solis y Cordero,
8:19which is a husband-and-wife team in Tarrazú.
8:23Narrator: Hara uses sight, smell, and sensors
8:26to track how the roast is developing.
8:28Finding the ideal roast level for each coffee
8:31is a skill that takes years to master.
8:34This tool that I'm using is called the trier,
8:37and it allows us to see the color of the development
8:40as we go through the roast
8:42and also to smell how the coffee is smelling.
8:44The green coffee will smell kind of like hay or grass.
8:47And you'll smell it get sweeter and sweeter and sweeter.
8:51You can smell some of that acidity come out.
8:53It'll smell almost vinegary-ish.
8:54As soon as that vinegar starts to fade just a little bit
8:57and there's a sweet fruitiness and a sweet baked-goods-ness,
9:00that's our finished development.
9:04Narrator: Metric roasts coffee for an average of 11 minutes
9:06before Hara releases it into the cooling tray
9:09to stop the roasting process.
9:12By comparison, commodity-coffee roasters
9:15favor a darker roast, which can cover up defects
9:18and make a blend of beans from different countries
9:20taste more uniform.
9:22While dark roasts are generally bitter,
9:24medium and light roasts offer more sweetness
9:27and bright acidity.
9:29Hara: You can blast it for a minute,
9:31and a lot of commodity coffee is just blasted
9:34as quick as possible,
9:35but it really rushes through all of those phases
9:38that develop all of the flavors.
9:40Going through those steps
9:41to get exactly the best qualities out of that coffee.
9:44We don't add anything to coffee.
9:46Everything was intrinsically there
9:48as the raw product from the farmer,
9:50from the growing conditions.
9:52Narrator: Light roasts also highlight
9:54the unique flavors of a region,
9:56allowing two single-origin coffees to taste very different.
10:00The tricky part about single origin versus blend
10:02is that you can achieve stellar results with blends
10:06and sometimes really subpar with single origin.
10:08And the same thing can be the other way around.
Drying and Milling
10:13Narrator: How a coffee is processed
10:15can have a big impact on its flavor and price.
10:19The washed process produces delicious coffee,
10:22but it's expensive and can be wasteful.
10:26Joseph: We use a lot of water,
10:27and the main challenge is how to dispose that wastewater,
10:32but we are trying to work on it
10:34by recycling the water we are using.
10:39Narrator: After spreading out the coffee,
10:41workers move it to a clean set of tables,
10:44where they continuously turn it by hand.
10:47This coffee takes around 14 days
10:50to reach a desired moisture content of 11% to 12%.
10:54The goal is uniform beans free of defects.
11:00Coffee at this stage is called parchment coffee
11:02because of the paperlike layer of material
11:05that surrounds the seed.
11:07Before producers ship the coffee,
11:08they mill it to remove the parchment.
11:11This is a small machine used for local consumption.
11:15When milling large quantities,
11:16the coffee goes through another round of grading.
11:19Each country has its own methods of grading.
11:22In Kenya, each bean is classified by size.
11:26The shape and color of the bean also impact the grade,
11:29but often the larger, denser beans are the most expensive.
11:34After months of work,
11:36producers are left with what's called green coffee.
11:39This is the product that will be exported
11:41and roasted in consuming countries.
11:44But this is also when the process becomes more opaque.
The price of coffee
11:49Farmers don't always know how much a buyer pays an exporter,
11:52so they don't know if they're being cut out
11:54of potential profit.
11:56The benchmark for the price of arabica coffee
11:58
follows what's called the C Market.
12:01It's an exchange, like the stock market,
12:03where traders buy and sell contracts
12:05based on the expected future value of coffee.
12:08But it doesn't consider the quality of the coffee.
12:11And the price is volatile,
12:13which makes it hard for farmers to operate sustainably.
12:16In 2019, the average closing price
12:19was $1.02 per pound.
12:22Its lowest point that year: $0.87.
12:25Despite inflation and increased cost of production,
12:28the C Market is almost the same as it was in 1980.
12:36Joseph is able to operate profitably,
12:38but that isn't the case for many farmers around the world.
12:42A 2019 study found that 44% of smallholder coffee farmers
12:46were living in poverty.
12:50Specialty coffee is bought at a premium
12:52above the commodity price.
12:55Joseph makes around $3.18 a pound.
12:59Joseph: Due to the high quality of our coffee,
13:02there is a lot of demand.
13:03But our expectation is that
13:05the demand should go with higher prices.
13:08Narrator: He says $4.55 a pound would be more sustainable,
13:13but his prices have actually decreased
13:15over the past few years.
13:17Joseph: I don't know the reason why.
13:19Mostly we are told world market has flooded with coffee,
13:24but we still need more explanation
13:27on why the coffee is going down
13:30when we are still trying our best
13:32to maintain our quality coffee.
13:35For those who are producing
13:37less than 5 kilos from one tree,
13:39they are not even breaking even.
13:42The effort we make to produce that quality coffee,
13:45I can say we are not well compensated by those prices.
13:50Narrator: Growing coffee requires steep investments,
13:53which don't always pay off for farmers.
14:10Narrator: Many roasters in the industry
14:11are working towards direct-trade partnerships
14:14that benefit the coffee producer.
14:16Xavier: I'm looking to do two things,
14:19source high-quality coffees,
14:20but also establish year-over-year relationships.
14:24Narrator: Some roasters also publish
14:25the prices they pay for green coffee,
14:28but the level of transparency varies.
14:30Xavier: We as roasters need to do our job
14:32to educate consumers as to the difference
14:35between a product from Colombia that's sourced fairly,
14:38that's sourced with full transparency,
14:40and a product of Colombia
14:41that has no traceability and is cheap.
14:44If it's cheap coffee, that means that somebody
14:47in the supply chain is not making it,
14:49and chances are it's going to be the producer.
14:51They're the ones at loss.
14:53Narrator: At retail, coffee from this region of Kenya
14:56has sold for $22.50 for a 12-ounce bag.
15:00That's over nine times what the farmers are paid.
15:04But just comparing those two numbers
15:06doesn't tell the whole story.
15:09Even when producers are paid a premium,
15:11there will always be a markup between coffee cherries
15:14and roasted coffee.
15:16Roasters typically pay more for single-origin coffee,
15:19but there's no definitive premium.
15:21Xavier: The real truth of it is
15:23that you can buy coffee at commodity pricing
15:26that actually meets specialty standards.
15:30For so long, the market has been so low
15:34and then the quality has been so high
15:36that producers need to sell their coffee.
15:39They need to earn a living.
15:40Because if they're not earning enough
15:42to cover the cost of production,
15:43not earning enough to just meet the minimum requirements
15:47to have a decent way of life,
15:49they're going to be edged out.
15:50That is what's happening all over the world.
15:55Narrator: Many throughout the specialty-coffee industry
15:57are working towards more transparency,
15:59better pay for producers,
16:01and more access to research and best practices.
16:04Ultimately, when coffee prices are low,
16:07the producers are the ones hurt the most.
