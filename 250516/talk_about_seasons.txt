Georgie
Hello and welcome to Real Easy English, the podcast where we have real conversations in easy English to help you learn. Iâ€™m Georgie.

Neil
And I'm Neil, and don't forget that this podcast is now available as a video on our website, so you can watch us at bbclearningenglish.com.

Georgie
Hi, Neil. How are you today?

Neil
Hi, Georgie. I'm very well, actually. I'm really happy today because the Sun is shining, and it's warm, and it seems like it's been a long time since we had such nice sunny weather.

Georgie
I know, the changing of the seasons is so wonderful, and actually, that's what we're talking about today. Today we're going to talk about the seasons and the different types of weather we get in the UK.

Neil
Yes. So in the UK we, our seasons are roughly like this. So March, April, May those are the spring seasons. Then we move into summer, which is June, July and August. Autumn, that's September, October, November. And then we're into winter for December, January, February.

Georgie
Yeah. More or less. Approximately. Yeah. So, Neil, what is your favourite season?

Neil
Well, you can probably guess because I'm so happy that it's spring and summer combined. So anything with long late nights and evenings I love.

Georgie
What else is good about summer?

Neil
In the summer, you can be outside. You can go swimming in the sea. You can stay up late and you have wonderful light in the UK. What's your favourite season then, Georgie?

Georgie
Well, I'm a big fan of the seasons, the transition seasons. So I really like spring and autumn, especially spring. Right now we're in spring in the UK, and you can see everyone looking happier because we've had a really long, hard, dark, cold winter and everyone is smiling now because they there are blossoms on the trees which make me so happy. I love seeing pink blossoms on the trees. The days are warmer and, yeah, there's this sense of a transition. Same with autumn. Although you're leaving the summer months, I really love the colours on the trees as well. Especially those cooler, crisp days when the sky is blue and the leaves are orange and brown. I love that.

Neil
Wow. You're making me look forward to autumn, and it's not even summer yet. Is there a season that you don't like?

Georgie
I do like all the seasons. I like to have balance, so I wouldn't like to have summer all year round, but I think, winter is my least favourite because of the dark days. In the UK I think it's particularly hard because, especially January and February, it's really cold and there's nothing really to get us through the the sad times.

Neil
I know exactly what you mean.

Georgie
There are good things about winter, but mostly it's just difficult, isn't it?

Neil
I agree. It's the dark. I can't stand it.

Georgie
Yeah. So, as I said, I quite like having the balance of different seasons throughout the year. I like to have transitions and changes. What about you, Neil? How do you feel about about that?

Neil
Yeah, I think I agree. I mean, it would be nice to have a shorter winter, but I think I would still prefer to have different seasons because, like I said, I really like the late light evenings in the summer. And I think even though I hate the dark winters, I would really miss that if the weather was nice all year, but got dark at the same time, like at six or seven o'clock.

Georgie
OK, let's recap the language we heard in the conversation. We learned different ways to talk about the seasons. For example, looking forward to that means you're excited for something to happen in the future.

Neil
That's right. So I'm really looking forward to the warm, light, sunny evenings in the summer.

Georgie
We heard to be a big fan of that means that you really like something. For example, I'm a big fan of spring and autumn.

Neil
Yes, Georgie is a big fan of the transition seasons. I'm not such a big fan of winter, though. I, actually, I can't stand it, which means that I really hate it.

Georgie
